# Computational Law

This is a Git repository of the Research Programme in Computational Law, hosted at the Centre for Computational Law at Singapore Management University.

We aim to build open-source tools and technologies that do for legal and qualitative reasoning, what the spreadsheet has done for quantitative reasoning.

Computational law has a long history. An introductory curriculum is available under [doc/](doc/).

## Areas of work

We maintain separate repositories for each work area below. Developers should clone them under `smucclaw/`

- [DSL](https://github.com/smucclaw/dsl/): a family of domain-specific languages suitable for expressing the semantics of contracts, laws, and rules.
- [NLG](https://github.com/smucclaw/nlg/): natural language generation allows us to "compile" from the DSL to English and other natural languages.
- [FV](https://github.com/smucclaw/fv/): formal verification of the specifications written in the DSL helps detect conflicts and loopholes at "compile time".
- [IDE](https://github.com/smucclaw/ide/): support for DSL developers in their favourite editor offers realtime feedback, document preview, and app preview.
- [DMN](https://github.com/smucclaw/dmnmd/): integration with the Decision Model & Notation standard for expressing constitutive rules efficiently in Markdown.

## We're Hiring!

Assistant Research Engineers, Trainees, and Research Engineers interested in working with us in Singapore are invited to submit an application through official channels. See [career portal](https://smu.recruiterpal.com/career/jobs).

## We're Open to Use Cases!

Practitioners from industry and government sectors are invited to
contact us to explore opportunities for collaboration.

Please initiate contact through a Github issue that describes in broad
strokes what you would like to achieve with our help.

## We're Open Source!

The CCLAW community gathers at:

Slack
: (TODO: set up an invite mechanism)

reddit
: (TODO: set up a subreddit)

Or rather, it will, once we're more set up.

## Code of Conduct

All participants are expected to abide by the code of conduct available [here](COC.md).

## Onboarding for Trainees and Junior Engineers
