	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to study the fundamental mechanism, humans use in argumentation, and to explore ways to implement this mechanism on computers. We do so by first developing a theory for argumentation whose central notion is the acceptability of arguments. Then we argue for the “correctness” or “appropriateness” of our theory with two strong arguments. The first one shows that most of the major approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning in AI and logic programming are special forms of our theory of argumentation. The second argument illustrates how our theory can be used to investigate the logical structure of many practical problems. This argument is based on a result showing that our theory captures naturally the solutions of the theory of n-person games and of the well-known stable marriage problem. By showing that argumentation can be viewed as a special form of logic programming with negation as failure, we introduce a general logic-programming-based method for generating meta-interpreters for argumentation systems, a method very much similar to the compiler-compiler idea in conventional programming.},

@article{amgoud_besnard_rule_based_argumentation_systems_2019,
	abstract = {Rule-based argumentation systems are developed for reasoning about defeasible information. As a major feature, their logical language distinguishes between strict rules (encoding strict information) and defeasible rules (describing general behavior with exceptional cases). They build arguments by chaining such rules, define attacks between them, use a semantics for evaluating the arguments and finally identify the plausible conclusions that follow from the rules. Focusing on the family of inconsistency-based attack relations, this paper presents the first study of the outcomes of such systems under various acceptability semantics, namely naive, stable, semi-stable, preferred, grounded and ideal. It starts by extending the existing list of rationality postulates that any rule-based system should satisfy. Then, it defines the key notion of option of a theory (a theory being a set of facts, a set of strict rules and a set of defeasible rules). For each of the cited semantics, it characterizes the extensions of a rule-based system that satisfies all the postulates in terms of options of the theory under which the system is built. It also fully characterizes the set of plausible conclusions of the system. The results show that designing a rule-based argumentation system requires great care.},

	abstract = {The LogiKEy workbench and dataset for ethical and legal reasoning is presented. This workbench simultaneously supports development, experimentation, assessment and deployment of formal logics and ethical and legal theories at different conceptual layers. More concretely, it comprises, in form of a dataset (Isabelle/HOL theory files), formal encodings of multiple deontic logics, logic combinations, deontic paradoxes and normative theories in the higher-order proof assistant system Isabelle/HOL. The data were acquired through application of the LogiKEy methodology, which supports experimentation with different normative theories, in different application scenarios, and which is not tied to specific logics or logic combinations. Our workbench consolidates related research contributions of the authors and it may serve as a starting point for further studies and experiments in flexible and expressive ethical and legal reasoning. It may also support hands-on teaching of non-trivial logic formalisms in lecture courses and tutorials. The LogiKEy methodology and framework is discussed in more detail in the companion research article titled “Designing Normative Theories for Ethical and Legal Reasoning: LogiKEy Framework, Methodology, and Tool Support” [5].},
