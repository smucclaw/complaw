\subsection{Proof of Finiteness}\label{sec:proof_finiteness}

We will prove the finiteness result of Theorem~\ref{thm:finiteness} via a series of lemmas. Also we will refer to specific lines of the encoding given below but the arguments in the proof are fully general and can be easily extended to the encoding of any abductive proof generation problem

\begin{lemma}
Let $S$ be the set of uninterpreted skolem functions appearing in the abducible
generation encoding. Let $C$ be the set of constants occurring in either a user
inputed fact in $U$ or the query $q$. Let $T_{k}$ denote the set of unique
terms that can be constructed from $S$ and $C$ with skolem depth at most
$k$. Let $T$  be the possibly infinite set consisting of terms of unbounded
depth. Then for any positive integer $k$, $T_{k}$ is finite.
\end{lemma}
% \remms{Better write: $T$ is the union of the $T_k$. However, the lemma does not say anything about $T$} 

\begin{proof}
This is a standard result which follows easily by induction. Clearly $|T_{0}|$ = $|C|$, which is finite. Let $|T_{k}|$ = $B$ be finite. Let $S$ be a set of $l$ functions having arity at most $d$. Then $|T_{k+1}|\leq B + lB^{d}$. Hence $T_{k+1}$ is finite.  
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
 For any predicate $p$ inside an $abducedFact$ atom the arguments of $p$ are elements of the set $T_{N}$. Similarly for any predicate $p$ inside an $holds$ atom the arguments of $p$ are elements of the set $T_{N}$. Similarly for the other atoms in any answer set of $P_{\langle R,q,U,C,N \rangle}^{res}$. Terms that correspond to arguments of predicates occuring in the input rules are always elements of $T_{N}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}\textit{(sketch)}. Firstly note that for any predicate $p$ inside a
$abducedFact$ or $holds$ atom, where $p$ comes from the input rule set, the
arguments of $p$ belong to the (possibly infinite) set $T$. We can see this by observing that
since no rule in $R$ contains a function symbol, the encoding of the rules
themselves such as in line 7,8 of the ASP program above, cannot introduce new
terms in the arguments of predicates inside $holds$ atoms. Similarly lines
like 23, 24 etc. also cannot introduce new terms inside $holds$, $create\_sub$
atoms in the final answer set, which means also that no new terms appear as
predicate arguments inside $abducedFact$ atoms.

Only lines like 14,15 are able to create fresh terms that become arguments of
various atoms in the answer set. But then it follows that any $holds$ atom,
$create\_sub$, $abducedFact$, $query$, $explains$ atoms can only have input
rule predicate arguments from the set $T$.

Next we show that the skolem depth of these terms is at most $N$. Any fresh
term $t$ from $T$ appearing in an atom in an answer set of the ASP program,
such that $t$ does not appear in any user provided fact or in the original
query $q$, must have been constructed from rules like in lines 14,15. But
these encode a 'static' space of abducibles, which unlike lines 23, 24 is
independent of the forward reasoning component or any user provided additional
facts. This is because any $query$ atom that gives an instantiation of the
right hand side of rules like the one in line 14, must have integer argument
less than $M-1=N$, (recall that we have $M=N+1$), whereas rules like the one
in line 24, gives us $query$ atoms with integer argument $M-1$. It is not hard
to see that because of this fresh terms created via ASP rules like the one on
line 14 must have skolem depth at most $N$. Therefore all terms inside atoms
of the answer-set that correspond to input rule predicate arguments must
belong to the set $T_{N}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
Since the set $T_{N}$ is finite it follows that any answer set of $P_{\langle
  R,q,U,C,N \rangle}^{res}$ is finite.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Since $T_{N}$ is finite and the integer argument of any $create\_sub$, $explains$, $query$ 
atom is bounded by $N$, any atom in the final answer set has only finitely
many instantiations. This proves finiteness of the resulting answer set.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Proof of Completeness}\label{sec:proof_completeness}

We now give a proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:completeness}.


Note that without loss of generality, for the sake of proving completeness, we may assume that the set of user supplied facts is empty. We will first need a preliminary lemma.

\begin{lemma}
Assume $\langle R,q,U,\emptyset,N\rangle$, $\langle R,q',U,\emptyset,N\rangle$ are two
problems satisfying the conditions above but $q'$ is obtained from $q$ by
possibly changing some or all of the arguments of $q$. Then $\langle
R,q,U,\emptyset,N\rangle$ has a solution $S_{ASP}$ derived from the ASP program $P_{\langle R,q,U,\emptyset,N\rangle}^{res}$ if and only if $\langle R,q',U,\emptyset,N\rangle$ has a solution $S'_{ASP}$ derived from the ASP program $P_{\langle R,q',U,\emptyset,N\rangle}^{res}$ We call such solutions ASP solutions for short.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We prove the lemma by induction on $N$.
The case $N = 0$ is trivial. If there exists a ASP solution for $\langle
R,q,U,\emptyset,0\rangle$ then any instance of the predicate in $q$ can be
abduced therefore $\langle R,q',U,\emptyset,0\rangle$ has a ASP solution. Assume
the result for all $N<k$ such that $k>0$. A non trivial ASP solution to
$\langle R,q,U,\emptyset,k+1\rangle$ (ie a solution in which no instance of the predicate in $q$ can be abduced) implies the existence of some ASP solution to
each of the following set of problems $\langle R,q_{pre_{i}},U,\emptyset,k\rangle$
where the $q_{pre_{i}}$ are a set of
pre-conditions of a rule $r$ in $R$, under some substitution $\theta$ where
$\theta$ applied to the post-condition of $r$ gives $q$. But then since the post- condition of $r$
contains no repeated variables, if $q$ unifies with the post condition of $r$
under some substituion $\theta$, then there exists some other substitution
$\theta'$ for the variables in $r$ such that $\theta'$ applied to the
postcondition of $r$ gives $q'$. Therefore the union of ASP solutions to the set of problems
$\langle R,q'_{pre_{i}},U,\emptyset,k\rangle$ is also a ASP solution to $\langle
R,q',U,\emptyset,k+1\rangle$ where each $q'_{pre_{i}}$ is obtained from
$q_{pre_{i}}$ by possibly changing the arguments in the predicate. By the
induction hypothesis an ASP solution to each of the problems $\langle
R,q'_{pre_{i}},U,\emptyset,k\rangle$ exists. Hence by taking the union of the solutions we get an ASP solution to  $\langle
R,q',U,\emptyset,k+1\rangle$. This proves the lemma.
\end{proof}

We now prove the main theorem by induction on $N$. 

\begin{proof}
The case $N=0$ is trivial. Assume
the result for all $N<k$, where $k>0$. The existence of a non-trivial general solution
to $\langle R,q,U,\emptyset,k+1\rangle$ implies the existence of a solution to each of the following set of problems, $\langle R,q_{pre_{i}},U,\emptyset,k\rangle$ where the $q_{pre_{i}}$ are the set of
pre-conditions of a rule $r$ in $R$, under some substitution $\theta$ where
$\theta$ applied to the post-condition of $r$ gives $q$. But then by the
inductive hypothesis there is an ASP each of the same set of problems. By
the lemma proved above there exists an ASP solution to each of the following set of
problems $\langle R,q'_{pre_{i}},U,\emptyset,k\rangle$, where each
$q'_{pre_{i}}$ is obtained from the corresponding $q_{pre_{i}}$, by possibly
replacing some predicate arguments with the appropriate skolem terms for
predicate arguments that correspond to existential variables in the
preconditions of $r$. Hence taking a union of these ASP solutions we get an ASP solution to
$\langle R,q,U,\emptyset,N\rangle$.
