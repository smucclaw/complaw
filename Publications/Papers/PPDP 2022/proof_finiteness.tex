\section{Finiteness and Completeness Properties of Simple Tasks}

\begin{theorem}[Finiteness]\label{thm:finiteness}
Assume that $\langle R,q,U,\emptyset,N \rangle$ is such that it is a simple abductive proof generation task. %$R$ is function free and
%also contains no arithmetic operations. $N$ is finite. $q$ is a ground
%positive atom containing no function symbols. $U$ contains some integrity
%constraints and ground positive atoms containing no function symbols.% Then
Then $P_{\langle R,q,U,\emptyset,N \rangle}^{res}$ cannot have infinite answer sets. 
\end{theorem}

The proof can be found in Section~\ref{sec:proof_finiteness}
