% \section{Completeness for simple  problems}\label{sec:completeness}

\begin{theorem}[Completeness]\label{thm:completeness}
  Given a simple a simple abductive proof generation task,if there exists a general solution $S$ to that task then there
  exists a ASP solution $S_{ASP}$ to that task corresponding to an answer set of the ASP program $P_{\langle R,q,U,\emptyset,N\rangle}^{res}$.
\end{theorem}

The proof can be found in Section~\ref{sec:proof_completenes}.

%\section{Summary of results - I}
Let us just comment on the results above in a slightly broader context . Firstly it is not difficult to see that the above results for finiteness and completeness hold for a slightly larger class of abductive proof generation tasks than the class of simple tasks. Namely we can in fact relax condition codition 7 in the definition of simple tasks, to allow $q$ to be un-ground or only partially ground. Call this class of abduction tasks $semi$-$simple$.  Also, the completeness result in fact holds if $P_{R,q,U,C,N}^{res}$ is replaced with $P_{R,q,U,C,N}^{semi-res}$. In summary what we have then is the following\\
Given a $\textit{semi-simple}$ task $\langle R,q,U,\emptyset,N\rangle$. $P_{R,q,U,C,N}^{res}$, $P_{R,q,U,C,N}^{semi-res}$, both enjoy the completeness and finiteness properties. However only $P_{R,q,U,C,N}^{semi-res}$ supports full implicit term substitution whereas $P_{R,q,U,C,N}^{res}$ only supports partial term substitution. We shall formulate and prove a formal result regarding term substitution for $P_{R,q,U,C,N}^{res}$ next.
