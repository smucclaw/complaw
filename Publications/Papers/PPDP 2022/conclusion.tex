\section{ Conclusion, related work, future directions}\label{sec:conclusion}
We have presented several encodings for abductive proof generation in ASP, incorporating notions of depth control and  novel implementations of term substitution. We have also given an encoding that allows one to generate a set of directed edges representing a justification graph.\\It seems to us that some of the ideas involved in the term substituion mechanism are similar to the ideas involved when one uses $\textit{Sideways Information Passing Strategies}$ [SIPS ref] to re-write datalog rules for more efficient evaluation of queries by incorporating elements of top-down reasoning. However we have not explored this connection in detail. It seems to us that those techniques typically involve a complete re-write of the input rules according some chosen fixed sideways information passing strategy, which makes that whole approach quite different to ours.\\ Possible future directions of work may include extending the formal results presented here to a larger class of abductive proof generation problems. It also seems to us that the main technique used to generate the directed edge set representing the justification graph could be adapted for use in SAT/SMT solvers to get justifications out of them. This too could be a potentially interesting avenue for future work.
