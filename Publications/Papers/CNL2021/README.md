## Abstract

We present a Controlled Natural Language (CNL), which is a component of L4,
a domain-specific programming language for drafting laws and contracts.
Along with formal verification, L4's core functionalities include natural language generation.
We present a Natural Language Generation (NLG) pipeline using the CNL, and an interactive process for ambiguity resolution.
