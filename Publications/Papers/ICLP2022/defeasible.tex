\section{Defeasible Reasoning in a Classical Logic}\label{sec:defeasible_classical}
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will describe how to give a precise semantics to the rule
modifiers, by rewriting rules, progressively eliminating the instructions
appearing in the rule annotations so that in the end, only purely logical
rules remain. Making the meaning of the modifiers explicit can therefore be
understood as a \emph{compilation} problem.  Whereas the first preprocessing
steps (\secref{sec:preprocessing}) are generic, there are several
possibilities
of conversion into logical format, the first discussed in the following
(\secrefs{sec:restr_precond}), the second in the extended version
(\secref{sec:restr_deriv}). We will then discuss rule inversion 
(\secref{sec:rule_inversion}) which gives our approach a non-monotonic flavour
while remaining entirely in a classical setting. Rule inversion will also be
instrumental for comparing the conversion variants in \secref{sec:comparison}.

\subsection{Rule Modifiers in Classical Logic}\label{sec:rule_modifiers_in_classical_logic}

% ......................................................................
\subsubsection{Preprocessing}\label{sec:preprocessing}

Preprocessing consists of several elimination steps that are carried out in a
fixed order.

\paragraph{\textbf{``Despite''  elimination}}

As can be concluded from the previous discussion, a
$\mathtt{despite}\; r_2$ clause appearing in rule $r_1$ is equivalent to a
$\mathtt{subjectTo}\; r_1$ clause in rule $r_2$. The first rule transformation
consists in applying exhaustively the following \emph{despite elimination}
rule transformer:
% \remms[inline]{In the whole discussion (and the implementation), make a
%   clearer distinction between rule set transformer \texttt{restrict} and rule
%   generator / transformer \texttt{derived}.}

\noindent
\emph{despiteElim:}\\
$
\{r_1 \{\mathtt{restrict}: \{\mathtt{despite}\; r_2\} \uplus a_1\},\;\;
r_2\{\mathtt{restrict}: a_2\}, \dots\} \longrightarrow$\\
$\{r_1 \{\mathtt{restrict}: a_1\},\;\;
r_2\{\mathtt{restrict}:  \{\mathtt{subjectTo}\; r_1\} \uplus a_2\}, \dots\}
$

\begin{example}\label{ex:rewrite_despite}
Application of this rewrite rule to the three example rules \texttt{maxSpCarWorkday},
\texttt{maxSpCarHighway} and  \texttt{maxSpSportsCar} changes them to:

\begin{lstlisting}[columns=fixed]
rule <maxSpCarWorkday> {restrict: {subjectTo: maxSpCarHighway}}
rule <maxSpCarHighway> {restrict: {subjectTo: maxSpSportsCar}}
rule <maxSpSportsCar>  {restrict: {subjectTo: maxSpCarWorkday}}
\end{lstlisting}
Here, only the headings are shown, the bodies of the rules are
unchanged. 
\end{example}

One defect of the rule set already becomes apparent to the human reader at
this point: the circular dependency of the rules. We will however continue
with our algorithm, applying the next step which will be to rewrite the
\texttt{\{restrict: \{subjectTo: \dots\}\}} clauses.  Please note that each
rule can be \texttt{subjectTo} several other rules, each of which may have a
complex structure as a result of transformations that are applied to it.

\paragraph{\textbf{``Subject To''  elimination}}

The rule transformer \emph{subjectToElim} does the following: it splits up the
rule into two rules, (1) its source (the rule body as originally given), and
(2) its definition as the result of applying a rule transformation function to
several rules.

\begin{example}\label{ex:rewrite_subject_to}
Before stating the rule transformer, we show its effect on rule
\texttt{maxSpCarWorkday} of \exampleref{ex:rewrite_despite}. On rewriting
with \emph{subjectToElim}, the rule is transformed into two rules:

\begin{lstlisting}
# new rule name, body of rule unchanged
rule <maxSpCarWorkday'Orig> {source}
   for v: Vehicle, d: Day, r: Road if isCar v && isWorkday d then maxSp v d r 90
# rule with header and without body
rule <maxSpCarWorkday>
   {derived: {apply: {restrictSubjectTo maxSpCarWorkday'Orig  maxSpSportsCar}}}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{example}

We can now state the transformation (after grouping the
\texttt{subjectTo $r_2$}, \dots, \texttt{subjectTo $r_n$} into
\texttt{subjectTo $[r_2 \dots r_n]$}):


\noindent
\emph{subjectToElim:}\\
$
\{r_1 \{\mathtt{restrict}: \{\mathtt{subjectTo}\; [r_2, \dots, r_n]\}\}, \dots \} \longrightarrow$\\
$\{r_1^o \{\mathtt{source}\}, r_1 \{\mathtt{derived:}\; \{\mathtt{apply:}\; \{
\mathtt{restrictSubjectTo}\;\; r_1^o\; [r_2 \dots r_n] \}\}\}, \dots \}
$



\paragraph{\textbf{Computation of derived rule}}
The last step consists in generating the derived rules, by evaluating the
value of the rule transformer expression marked by \texttt{apply}. The rules
appearing in these expressions may themselves be defined by complex
expressions. However, direct or indirect recursion of the transformers is not allowed. For
simplifying the expressions in a rule set, we compute a rule dependency order
$\prec_R$ defined by: $r \prec_R r'$ iff $r$ appears in the defining
expression of $r'$. If $\prec_R$ is not a strict partial order (in particular, if
it is not cycle-free), then evaluation fails. Otherwise, we order the rules
topologically by $\prec_R$ and evaluate the expressions starting from the
minimal elements. Obviously, the order $\prec_R$ does not prevent rules themselves from being recursive.

\begin{example}
It is at this point that the cyclic dependence already remarked after
\exampleref{ex:rewrite_despite} will be discovered. We have:

\noindent
\texttt{maxSpCarWorkday'Orig}, \texttt{maxSpCarHighway} $\prec_R$ \texttt{maxSpCarWorkday}\\
\texttt{maxSpCarHighway'Orig}, \texttt{maxSpSportsCar} $\prec_R$ \texttt{maxSpCarHighway}\\
\texttt{maxSpSportsCar'Orig}, \texttt{maxSpCarWorkday} $\prec_R$  \texttt{maxSpSportsCar}\\
\noindent
which cannot be totally ordered.

Let us fix the problem by changing the heading of rule
\texttt{maxSpCarHighway} from \texttt{despite} to \texttt{subjectTo}:
\begin{lstlisting}
rule <maxSpCarHighway> {restrict: {subjectTo: maxSpCarWorkday}}
\end{lstlisting}

After rerunning \emph{despiteElim} and \emph{subjectToElim}, we can now order
the rules:

% \begin{lstlisting}
% rule <maxSpCarWorkday>
% rule <maxSpCarHighway>
%   {restrict: {subjectTo: maxSpCarWorkday, maxSpSportsCar}}
% rule <maxSpSportsCar>
%   {restrict: {subjectTo: maxSpCarWorkday}}
% \end{lstlisting}

\noindent
\{ \texttt{maxSpSportsCar'Orig}
\texttt{maxSpCarHighway'Orig},
\texttt{maxSpCarWorkday} \} $\prec_R$
\texttt{maxSpSportsCar} $\prec_R$
\texttt{maxSpCarHighway}
and will use this order for rule elaboration.
\end{example}


% ......................................................................
\subsubsection{Restriction via Preconditions}\label{sec:restr_precond}

Here, we propose one possible implementation of the rule transformer
\texttt{restrictSubjectTo} introduced in \secref{sec:preprocessing} that takes
a rule $r_1$ and a list of rules $[r_2 \dots r_n]$ and produces a new rule, by
adding the negation of the preconditions of $[r_2 \dots r_n]$ to $r_1$. More
formally:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathtt{restrictSubjectTo}\; r_1\; [] = r_1$
\item $\mathtt{restrictSubjectTo}\; r_1\; (r' \uplus rs) =$\\
  $\mathtt{restrictSubjectTo}\; (r_1(precond := precond(r_1) \AND \NOT precond(r')))\; rs$
\end{itemize}
where $precond(r)$ selects the precondition of rule $r$ and $r(precond:=p)$
updates the precondition of rule $r$ with $p$.
There is one proviso to the application of \texttt{restrictSubjectTo}: the
rules have to have the same \emph{parameter interface}: the number and types
of the parameters in the rules' \texttt{for} clause have to be the same; 
rules with different parameter interfaces can be adapted.

% via the
% \texttt{remap} rule transformer. The rule 

% \begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,mathescape=true]
% rule <r> for $x_1$:$T_1$ $\dots$ $x_n$:$T_n$ if Pre($x_1, \dots, x_n$) then Post($x_1, \dots, x_n$)
% \end{lstlisting}
% is remapped by \texttt{remap r [$y_1: S_1, \dots, y_m: S_m$] [$x_1 := e_1, \dots, x_n := e_n$]}
% to 
% \begin{lstlisting}[frame=none,mathescape=true]
% rule <r> for $y_1$: $S_1$ $\dots$ $y_m$: $S_m$ if Pre($e_1, \dots, e_n$) then Post($e_1, \dots, e_n$)
% \end{lstlisting}
% Here, $e_1, \dots, e_n$ are expressions that have to be well-typed with types $E_1, \dots, E_n$ in
% context $y_1: S_1, \dots, y_m: S_m$ (which means in particular that they may
% contain the variables $y_i$) with $E_i \preceq T_i$,  (with the consequence that
% the pre- and post-conditions of the new rule remain well-typed), where $\preceq$ is subtyping. 


\begin{example}
We come back to the running example. When processing the rules in the order of
$\prec_R$, rule \texttt{maxSpSportsCar}, defined by
\texttt{apply: \{restrictSubjectTo maxSpSportsCar'Orig maxSpCarWorkday\}},
becomes:
\begin{lstlisting}
rule <maxSpSportsCar>
   for v: Vehicle, d: Day, r: Road
   if isSportsCar v && isHighway r && not (isCar v && isWorkday d) 
   then maxSp v d r 320
 \end{lstlisting}

%  We can now state \texttt{maxSpCarHighway}, which has been defined by
%  \texttt{apply: \{restrictSubjectTo maxSpCarHighway'Orig maxSpSportsCar\}}, as:

%  \begin{lstlisting}
% rule <maxSpCarHighway>
%    for v: Vehicle, d: Day, r: Road
%    if isCar v && isHighway r &&
%       not (isSportsCar v && isHighway r && not (isCar v && isWorkday d)  &&
%            not (isCar v && isWorkday d))
%    then maxSp v d r 130
% \end{lstlisting}

\end{example}

One downside of the approach of adding negated preconditions is that the
preconditions of rules can become very complex. An alternative approach
leading to more compact formulas is presented in \ref{sec:comparison_proofs}.
% This effect is mitigated by
% the fact that conditions in \texttt{subjectTo} and \texttt{despite} clauses
% express specialisation or refinement and often permit substantial
% simplifications. Thus, the precondition of \texttt{maxSpSportsCar} simplifies
% to \texttt{isSportsCar v \&\& isHighway r \&\& isWorkday d} and the
% precondition of \texttt{maxSpCarHighway} to
% \texttt{isCar v \&\& isHighway r \&\& not (isSportsCar v \&\& isWorkday d)}.

\subsection{Rule Inversion}\label{sec:rule_inversion}

The purpose of this section is to derive formulas that, for a given rule set,
simulate negation as failure, but are coded in a classical first-order logic,
do not require a dedicated proof engine (such as Prolog) and can be checked
with a SAT or SMT solver. The net effect is similar to the completion
introduced by \cite{clark_NegAsFailure_1978}; however, the justification
is not operational as in \cite{clark_NegAsFailure_1978}, but takes inductive
closure as a point of departure. Some of the ideas are reminiscent of least
fixpoint semantics of logic programs, as discussed in
\cite{falaschi_etal_declarative_logic_langauges_1989,fages_consistency_clark_completion_1994}.
The discussion below applies to a considerably wider class of formulas.

In the following, we assume that our rules have an atomic predicate $P$ as
conclusion, whereas the precondition $Pre$ can be an arbitrarily complex
formula.  We furthermore assume that rules are in \emph{normalized form}: $P$
may only be applied to $n$ distinct variables $x_1, \dots, x_n$, where $n$ is
the arity of $P$, and the rule quantifies over exactly these variables.
For notational simplicity, we write normalized rules in logical format,
ignoring types:
$\forall x_1, \dots, x_n. Pre(x_1, \dots x_n) \IMPL Post(x_1, \dots, x_n)$.

Every rule can be written in normalized form, by applying the following
algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
\item Remove expressions or duplicate variables in the conclusion, by using
  the equivalences $P(\dots e \dots) = (\forall x. x = e \IMPL P(\dots x
  \dots))$ for a fresh variable x, and similarly $P(\dots y \dots y \dots) =
  (\forall x. x = y   \IMPL P(\dots x \dots y \dots))$.
\item Remove variables from the universal quantifier prefix if they do not
  occur in the conclusion, by using the equivalence
  $(\forall x. Pre(\dots x \dots) \IMPL P) = (\exists x. Pre(\dots x \dots))
  \IMPL P$.
\end{itemize}

For any rule set $\cal R$ and predicate $P$, we can form the set of
$P$-rules, ${\cal R}[P]$, as
\begin{align*}
\{ & \forall x_1, \dots, x_n. Pre_1[P](x_1, \dots x_n) \IMPL P(x_1, \dots, x_n),
     \dots,\\
  & \forall x_1, \dots, x_n.Pre_k[P](x_1, \dots x_n)\IMPL P(x_1, \dots,
x_n)\}
\end{align*}
as the subset of $\cal R$ containing all rules having $P$ as
post-condition. The notation $F[P]$ is meant to indicate that the $F$ can
contain $P$. It can also be taken as a \emph{functional}, \ie{} a higher-order
function having $P$ as parameter.

We say that a functional $F$ is \emph{semantically monotonic} if
\[
  (\forall x_1, \dots, x_n.\; P(x_1, \dots, x_n) \IMPL P'(x_1, \dots, x_n)) \IMPL 
  (\forall \overrightarrow{v}. F[P] \IMPL F[P'])
\]
A sufficient condition for semantic monotonicity is syntactic monotonicity:
$P$ does not occur under an odd number of negations in $F$. 

The inductive closure of a set of $P$-rules is the predicate $P^*$ defined by
the second-order formula
\[  P^*(x_1, \dots, x_n) = \forall P.\; (\bigwedge{\cal R}[P]) \IMPL P(x_1, \dots x_n) \]
where $\bigwedge{\cal R}[P]$ is the conjunction of all the rules in ${\cal R}[P]$.

$P^*$ can be understood as the least predicate satisfying the set of $P$-rules
and is the predicate that represents ``all that is known about $P$ and
assuming nothing else about $P$ is true'', and corresponds to the notion of
exhaustiveness prevalent in law texts. It can also be understood as the static
equivalent of the operational concept of negation as failure for predicate
$P$.  By the Knaster-Tarski theorem, $P^*$, as the least fixpoint of a
monotonic functional, is consistent.
% (see a counterexample in
% \exampleref{ex:syntactically_non_monotonic_rule}). 

Obviously, a second-order formula such as the definition of $P^*$ is unwieldy
in fully automated theorem proving, so we derive one particular consequence:

\begin{proposition}\label{lemma:p_star}
$P^*(x_1, \dots, x_n) \IMPL Pre_1[P^*](x_1, \dots x_n) \OR \dots \OR Pre_k[P^*](x_1, \dots x_n)$
\end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
% Expand the definition of $P^*$ and instantiate the universal variable $P$ with
% $\lambda x_1 \dots x_n. Pre_1(x_1, \dots x_n) \OR \dots \OR Pre_k(x_1, \dots x_n)$.
% \end{proof}
As a consequence of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem, there is no first-order
equivalent of $P^*$: a formula of the form $P^*$ can characterize the natural
numbers up to isomorphism, but no first-order formula can.

In the absence of such a first-order equivalent, we define the formula $Inv_P$
\[
\forall x_1, \dots, x_n.\;  P(x_1, \dots, x_n) \IMPL Pre_1(x_1, \dots x_n) \OR \dots \OR Pre_k[P](x_1, \dots x_n)
\]
called the \emph{inversion formula of  $P$}, and take it as an approximation of the
effect of $P^*$ in \propositionref{lemma:p_star}.

As usual, a disjunction over an empty set is taken to be the falsum
$\bot$. Assume there are no defining rules for a predicate $P$, then $Inv_P =
P \IMPL \bot = \NOT P$, which corresponds to a closed-world assumption for
$P$. This approach is entirely
based on a classical monotonic logic, in spite of non-monotonic
effects.

% \begin{example}\label{ex:syntactically_non_monotonic_rule}
%   One motivation for the monotonicity constraint is the following: The
%   simplest example of a rule that is not syntactically monotonic is
%   $\NOT P \IMPL P$. Its inversion is $P \IMPL \NOT P$. The two formulas
%   together, $P \IFF \NOT P$, are inconsistent.
% \end{example}

% Inversion formulas can be automatically derived and added to the rule set in
% L4 proofs; they turn out to be essential for consistency properties. For
% example, the functionality of \texttt{maxSp} stated in \figref{fig:assertions}
% is not provable without the inversion formula of \texttt{maxSp}.

% To avoid misunderstandings, we should emphasize that this approach is entirely
% based on a classical monotonic logic, in spite of non-monotonic
% effects. Adding a new $P$-rule may invalidate previously provable facts, but
% this is only so because the new rule alters the inversion formula of $P$.
