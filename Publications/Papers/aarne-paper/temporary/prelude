\begin{abstract}
This paper describes an experimental pipeline starting from ordinary English law text, parsing it with a formal grammar, and converting it to logical formulas via a series of structural representations.
The goal is to see how to cover the full pipeline with a sequence of well-understood rule-based steps.
The approach is outside-in: we wanted to deliver some output from day 1, and refined it as we went on.
Thus it is a rule-based robust approach.
%%
The law text addressed is one chapter of law of Singapore, Part 6A of the Personal Data Protection Act 2012.
While more work is needed to port the method to other law texts, we believe to have achieved a reusable modular structure, as well as some reusable code, for a more general pipeline.
The pipeline includes some new methods and concepts, in particular, annotation-based grammar writing and an assemply logic for two-dimensional spreadsheet representations.
The code is available as open source.
