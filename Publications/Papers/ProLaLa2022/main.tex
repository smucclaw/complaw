\section{Context}\label{sec:context}

Computerized support for law has a long tradition going back at least to the
1970. While the participants of the present workshop presumably share an
interest in the topic, there are different methods for approaching it. The
purpose of this paper is to expose the main tenets of our work at the Centre
for Computational Law \footnote{\url{https://cclaw.smu.edu.sg/}} at Singapore
Management University. We describe some basic principles in this section, and
then give an overview of current work (\secref{sec:current_work}) and work
still to be accomplished (\secref{sec:outlook}).
