Supplement to the README file for the Rail package, version 1.2 #1

The Rail package is now able to work with LaTeX2e. It also contains some minor
changes of functionality in comparison to the original version. The
documentation has been modified accordingly.

I was not able to reach the original author via e-mail. But I like the package
and want to keep it alive. Have fun!
