#+TITLE: An Introductory Course in Formal Languages and Protocols in Computational Law

This document lives at https://github.com/smucclaw/complaw/tree/master/doc/intro-course.org

* Introduction

This course was designed in mid-2017 to survey the field of computational contracts, which is just now emerging from academia toward industrial practice. It has been regularly updated since and was reviewed in 2020.

** Audiences

The course is intended for specific audiences.

One, the non-technical reader with some experience with the legal profession, considering a career in legal engineering, unafraid to dip a toe into computer science. A bright young law student, perhaps with some natural affinity for programming, who seeks alternatives to the standard future: junior associate, senior associate, partner, corpse.

Two, the technical reader, perhaps a self-taught or [[http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/][classically educated programmer]], who is interested in approaching contract law as a special case of applied computer science.

** By the end of this course

You will gain passing acquaintance with the foundational technologies, past and current efforts, and leading figures in the field of computational law in general, and computable contracts and legislation in particular.

** Course Structure

This is a self-study course. It's mostly readings, web pages, and some videos.

If you get stuck, ask for help.

* Volume 1 (two days) -- Background Survey

** Motivation and Explication

1. What if we could write contracts (and statutes) the way we do programs? (Not to mention compile, test, debug, and verify ... or even share and sell.)
2. http://compk.stanford.edu/ articulates the vision.
3. Harry Surden (2014) explains computable contracts on his blog ([[http://www.harrysurden.com/wordpress/archives/203][part 1]], [[http://www.harrysurden.com/wordpress/archives/230][part 2]]).
4. Eventually, professional services will be provided around contract drafting. Wait -- law firms already do that! Except, by and large, without technology and tools. Automation is just the first step.
5. Darmstadter's [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8axPLLxhjQFWGc0ellBYTF3RnM][Precision's Counterfeit]] angsts about the problem from the point of view of a lawyer.
6. One premise of the approach in this course is that the CS field of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification][Formal Verification]] has much to offer. In Sep 2017 the Atlantic Magazine discussed how FV could save the world from [[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/][The Coming Software Apocalypse]].

** A Quick Survey of Prior Art in Computable Contracts

Ready to add some tabs to your browser?

The three most important readings are marked *IMPORTANT* below. If you print anything, print those. Skim everything else, but read those.

Computable contracts is a narrow segment of computational law, which goes back over 30 years. For a sense of the larger field, see [[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259872879_The_TAXMAN_Project_Towards_a_Cognitive_Theory_of_Legal_Argument][the contents page of Computer Science and Law]] (1979), [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxOaYa8pqqSwNWg4d1lsSGJnSVE][the ICAIL retrospective]] "A History of AI and Law in 50 papers" (2012), and [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxOaYa8pqqSwNFlaNEUzd1d3RGc][slides from the intro to AI & Law workshop at ICAIL 2017]].

Meng gave [[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qP7Immmo51Rik9X96KmyZPLi2zC2mGQSTgsWccq3wNA/edit#slide=id.g228038fb28_0_3][a presentation covering some of this material]] at CodeX on 2017-09-09. The novel version of that movie is available at https://github.com/legalese/complaw-deeptech/blob/master/doc/chapter-201707.org ([[http://legalese.github.io/doc/chapter-201707.html][HTML version]]).

13. In 2017, [[http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/smartlaw2017/papers/SmartLaw2017_paper_1.pdf][Eric Tjong Tjin Tai]] from Tilburg, NL, published a short paper, "[[http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/smartlaw2017/papers/SmartLaw2017_paper_1.pdf][Formalizing Contract Law for Smart Contracts]]".
14. Most contract law concerns itself primarily with deontic logic; but parties must give notice to one another, and we might call that epistemic logic. Some people in Amsterdam have been working on [[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-48561-3_30][model checking of epistemic logic]].

** Prior Art in Regulations, Compliance, and Rules

Contracts are private law; legislation and regulation are public law. Enterprises have internal laws, called Business Rules.

1. Vinay Gupta (2017) motivated computable legislation in his manifesto [[http://internetofagreements.com/][The Internet of Agreements]]: smart contracts need smart law.
2. In Australia, [[http://www.governatori.net/research/pubs/index.html][Guido Governatori]] has been doing for legislation what the above efforts do for contracts. http://digital-legislation.net describes computable legislation and regulations; see the [[https://digital-legislation.net/img/concept-map.pdf][marketecture PDF]]. His previous efforts include Regorous and DrContract.
3. [[https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/monica.palmirani/en][Monica Palmirani]] chairs the [[https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=legalruleml][OASIS committee]] for [[http://www.governatori.net/papers/2013/ruleml2013tutorial.pdf][LegalRuleML]] (2013 tutorial). See the [[https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/legalruleml/][mailing list archives]].

4. [[http://www.r3.com/][R3]] has raised a lot of money. They work with banks, because that's where the money is. They run [[https://www.eventsforce.net/r3/frontend/reg/tAgendaWebsite.csp?pageID=1976&ef_sel_menu=44&eventID=9&mode=&eventID=9][summits on smart contracts]] and have published on smart contract templates: [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00771][foundations]] and [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.04496][requirements]] (2016). See [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxOaYa8pqqSwWTAzS3hjZUlVWUk/view?usp=sharing][slides from June 2016]] and [[https://www.r3.com/slides/third-smart-contract-templates-summit-slides.pdf][June 2017]].

*** Learning Exercise: Shipping Boxes

You and your life partner recently retired from a long and successful career in software engineering. As a retirement job, you decide to open a small grocery convenience store franchise together. You have spent six hours a day pair programming with your partner for the last 30 years, and you think that a change of pace will be pleasant for the two of you. The grocery franchise headquarters sends you these rules:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Delivery is offered for standard or non-standard box when more than half full. Delivery is free when a standard box is more than half full and contains at least $100.00 of groceries. Delivery of all non-standard boxes is charged.
#+END_QUOTE

You print those three sentences on a piece of A3 poster paper and tell your two junior staffers to post it on the wall next to the eggs and milk. You and your partner go out to run an errand. When you get back, the place is a mess! All the eggs are smashed and the milk is spilled. "What happened?" you ask. One of your junior staff has a black eye; the other has a bruised chin. They answer: "customers kept coming to us with different combinations of boxes, fullness, and grocery value. And we couldn't agree on what the rules meant. We used our discretion, but we would decide similar cases differently for different customers. The customers started to fight with us. They called us racist. Then we started to fight with each other; we called each other stupid. Now we need more eggs."

You say to the staff, "come on, how hard can this be? Take down the poster. We'll do a new version."

Reaching for a fresh sheet of paper, grinning at your partner because it feels like you've done this a thousand times before, you say: "Shall we begin?"

Before you read more about this exercise online, try to rewrite those rules yourself. As this is a learning exercise, feel free to produce multiple representations as you sketch your way toward a goal. Use any formats or languages you like: you can write functions in C, Javascript, or Python. You can write a logic program in Prolog, if you know Prolog. You can set up a system of SQL queries, if you know SQL. You can draw a flowchart, or a decision tree, or a decision table. Or you can draft it in English.

This exercise was first posed on Twitter: https://twitter.com/jrpotvin/status/1264895071549349889?s=20. A few experts in computational law responded by offering implementations in a range of different notations and languages. This is called "programming chrestomathy". In practice, it means, "I need to do some basic thing in a new language I'm learning. I'll go look it up on Rosetta Code".

After you have produced your version of the rules, run these test cases, and compare your outputs to your classmates'.

What happens when:
1. a     standard box, more      than half full, contains $200 of groceries?
3. a non-standard box, more      than half full, contains $200 of groceries?
2. a non-standard box,      less than half full, contains $200 of groceries?
4. a     standard box,      less than half full, contains $200 of groceries?

Your classmates may produce implementations that disagree with yours: they may return different outputs for the same inputs. You might believe they are wrong; they might believe you are wrong. What is going on? Is there a bug in their code? A bug in your code? A bug in the spec? As experienced programmers, how do you approach this situation?

Discuss.

This exercise introduces a number of concepts:
- qualifiers as operators: X when Y. Y => X versus Y <=> X.
- operator binding and precedence; anaphora resolution
- conjunctive and disjunctive expansion
- quantifier binding: what is the difference between "delivery of all non-standard boxes is charged", or "all delivery of non-standard boxes is charged"?
- rule fragments and granularity; clauses and sub-clauses.
- binary versus ternary logic -- the law of the excluded middle -- the closed-world assumption.
- natural language versus propositional logic
- Logical implication versus Gricean implicatures. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/implicature/#GricTheo
- ontological representation of concepts

* Volume 3 (one to two years) -- Advanced Background

/This section is under construction./

There is enough material in here for a Master's degree. If you go fast, you could cover it all in a year. If you go deep, it might take two.

You will understand the mathematical logic and architectural decisions that inform the design of the L4 language.

You'll be ready to start developing and extending the core language itself, the way Guido van Rossum develops Python, the way Mats develops Ruby, the way DHH developed Rails.

When you attend academic conferences about law and logic, you will be able to follow the arguments of wizards about the fine points of action logics vs state logics; about whether Hvitved loses anything by defining permission in terms of counterparty obligations; about whether CSL, CL, or FL better sidesteps the paradoxes of Standard Deontic Logic; about whether Governatori's defeasible logics map elegantly to SBVR and LegalRuleML.

          was the ratepayer of a residential property

   is entitled, on application in that year,
   to a rebate of—

    (a) so much of the rates payable for that rating year
        in respect of the property as represents—

        (i)  two-thirds of the amount by which those rates exceed $160,

            becomes the ratepayer of another residential property,
     is entitled to
        a rates rebate under subsection (1).
     The amount of the rebate must be apportioned according to
     the amount of time the ratepayer was the ratepayer of each
     residential property during the rating year.

(2) The Governor-General may
    from time to time, by Order in Council,
    amend the provisions of subsection (1)

We put it into open fisca, and its been running in production for nearly 3 years. (3 years of Rebates). I've got a report that its not doing the right numbers just for this year, but not much further info. so I'm rereading that legislation to see they mean by "wrong numbers".

ratepayer_income = 50000
dependents = 4

what is the rebate?

2/3*(5000-160) - (50000 - (25180 + 500*4)) / 8

2/3*(rate_payable-160) - (ratepayer_income - (25180 + 500*dependents)) / 8

****** how did the bug arrive in the code?

surfacing bugs is a pain in the ass; consider the case reported in https://www.modernanalyst.com/Resources/Articles/tabid/115/ID/3109/The-Role-of-SQL-in-Decision-Centric-Processes.aspx

We have another example that demonstrates this in practice. A government front-line department had miscalculated average daily pay for a decade, thereby underpaying all termination payments. The average daily pay had to be recalculated for the entire period from original source data. So in the new process, daily accumulators were created for every day that an employee was employed. Then every payment that spanned any given day needed to be added to the day’s average on a pro-rated basis: for instance, weekly and overtime earnings, shift allowances, various monthly, quarterly, and annual adverse condition and other bonuses, annual and long service leave etc. The ‘provenance’ of each and every payment made had to be assessed against the provenance of each individual daily accumulator – that is, the context of every payment to the employee had to be matched with the context of the daily accumulator, while that specific accumulator was being processed.

****** could we do better? how would we know we are doing better?

******* we could rewrite the implementation in OpenFisca

******** a discussion of OpenFisca

https://openfisca.org/doc/coding-the-legislation/25_vectorial_computing.html
vectorial computing basically means that all formulas operate in the Array monad.

this idea of "vectorial" computing shows up in Prolog and in Alloy as well.


******* we could rewrite the implementation in some other pet language
******* but all of these rewrites would suffer the same problem as the original

******* Dunning-Krueger effect

******* this has been discussed in 

******** https://sci-hub.tw/10.1145/112646.112660#

******* how can we have more confidence in the software we produce?

this is an old question in software engineering

we offer three ways to answer this question:
- tests (which descends from Zermelo's answer to the Russell Paradox: set theory)
- correctness by construction (which descends from Russell's answer to the paradox: type theory)
- natural language isomorphism

tests expand to model checking, SAT/SMT

correctness by construction expand to ITP/ATP CoQ, B, specification languages

these approaches intertwine; Alloy and TLA+ backend to SAT engines and model checkers

natural language isomorphism is a novel approach: it complements the other two.

****** they could have had test cases and illustrative examples

******* test cases might have surfaced the bug

- Defeasible Logic: Governatori. Finite Automata.
- Prolog and OWL together: DR-PROLOG [4] is an implementation of a system for defeasible reasoning on the web, specifically aimed at the semantic web technologies allowing reasoning with rules and ontological knowledge written in RDF Schema (RDFS) or OWL. (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220254273_A_review_of_current_defeasible_reasoning_implementations 2008)


What does all this mean for us?

Applying these concepts to the legal domain, doing some violence in translation along the way, we might simplify to say:

- Epistemic Logic :: Did Party A give notice to Party B about Fact F? Party C represented & warranted, in a contract already signed, that they had no knowledge that Fact F might be true; they believed it was false. Can Party D demonstrate that Party C was lying? Perhaps if Party D gave Party C notice about Fact F being true before the contract was signed.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_act#In_multiagent_universes

- Deontic Logic :: Is Party A obliged to perform act X by deadline D?
- Temporal Logic :: Is condition C /always/ or /sometimes/ true across a time span T1 to T2?
- Defeasible Logic :: You have to do what Dad tells you to do, unless Mom tells you differently.
- Dynamic Logic :: Let's model the future as a set of actions and assertion/invariants that hold or don't, after those actions. If Party A performs action X, then they must perform action Y immediately afterwards or they will breach the contract. If Party A checks in luggage weighing more than 25 kg, they must immediately pay a $50 surcharge, or they will not be allowed on the flight.
- Kripke structures :: Once this assertion is true, how do we know it will always be true? What could make it untrue? What can we know about related assertions?
- Petri Nets :: Visualize our future state transitions.

https://www.academia.edu/36734121/A_Simple_Semi-automated_Proof_Assistant_for_First-order_Modal_Logics (see citation 5 in particular)

Positional-Slotted, Object-Applicative RuleML (PSOA RuleML) permits relation applications with optional object identifiers and, orthogonally, arguments that are positional or slotted. The resulting positional-slotted, object-applicative (psoa) terms and rules over them were given a first-order model-theoretic foundation (paper, slides), blending slot distribution, as in RIF, with integrated psoa terms, as in RuleML. In order to support reasoning in PSOA RuleML, the implemention of the PSOA2TPTP translator is in progress, which maps PSOA RuleML knowledge bases to the TPTP format, as widely used for theorem provers. With this translator, reasoning in PSOA RuleML is available using the VampirePrime prover. The composition of PSOA2TPTP and VampirePrime to PSOATransRun is being developed at PSOA RuleML.

- Language Features for L4 concrete syntax

  - specification rather than implementation language :: supports refinement to multiple targets

  - declarative rather than imperative :: though certain rules may be described "within a 'do' monad"

  - progressive refinement may be considered an extremely verbose syntax :: imagine giving a class definition using one sentence for each keyword, one paragraph for each attribute (although subclassing represents one approach to progressive refinement which is more cognate). There is some meat to this idea: maybe one family of ideas is (unit testing with manual tests, set-theoretic approaches, case based reasoning); another is (reasoning from principles, type-theoretic approaches, ATP/ITP, property-based testing); is there a convergence between these schools of thought?

  - rewriting :: refactoring at the level of macros

  - counterfactual :: see for example companies act regarding waiver of AGM: many rules operate as if the AGM had not been waived

  - principled reasoning :: overaps with defeasibility, because one principle can override another, and there can be meta meta rules; this reminds me of the metarule logic developed by that japanese dude who presented at salzburg 2017

  - default rules :: lurking in the background, provided by legislation and by case law

  - defeasibility :: every predicate is augmented with an invisible "well, unless"; this interacts with the "rewriting" feature

  - case-based vs rule-based :: some rule decisions can be punted to something more resembling ML case-based reasoning, with KNN etc; see CMMN from OMG

  - introspection :: any rule which involves gender shall be adjusted to be gender neutral
