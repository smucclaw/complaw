* Background

Consider https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/02/science/math-equation-pedmas-bemdas-bedmas.html

* Case

http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1973/0005/latest/whole.html#DLM409673

#+begin_src text
A ratepayer who, at the commencement of a rating year, was the
ratepayer of a residential property is entitled, on application in
that year, to a rebate of --

    (a) so much of the rates payable for that rating year in respect of
        the property as represents --

        (i) two-thirds of the amount by which those rates exceed $160, reduced by --

        (ii) $1 for each $8 by which the ratepayer’s income for the
             preceding tax year exceeded $25,660, that last-mentioned amount
             being increased by $500 in respect of each person who was a
             dependant of the ratepayer at the commencement of the rating year
             in respect of which the application is made; or

    (b) $640, --

whichever amount is smaller.

Represent this as a mathematical formula.

Write a program that implements the formula.

* Test Cases

What does your program do with the following input?

| Case | RatesPayableTotal | Combined Income | Dependants |
|------+-------------------+-----------------+------------|
|    1 |              1000 |           24000 |          0 |
|    2 |              1000 |           32000 |          0 |

What do your results mean?

rebate = min(640, (2/3) * (ratesPayableTotal-160) - (1/8 * (combinedIncome + dependants * 500 - 25660))

Did you get $640? Or did you get $560? What do you get when you work it through by hand?

* Learning Objectives
** Ambiguity
*** what does "X reduced by Y" mean?
*** what does "the amount by which X exceeds Y" mean?
** Approaches in static analysis:
*** Symbolic execution
*** Types
Integers versus Natural Numbers
*** Dependent types
*** Refinement types

* Commit

Don't look at the bugfix until you've fully absorbed everything you can learn from the case.
