* A Short Introduction

** Demand

In 2020, the European Union [[https://etendering.ted.europa.eu/cft/cft-display.html?cftId=6051][announced a tender]] for machine-readable and -executable regulations for regulatory reporting.

The US Government shared their thinking about how [[https://18f.gsa.gov/2020/05/12/rapid-implementation-of-policy-as-code/][computational law could accelerate]] implementation of policy as code.

Juro, a LegalTech startup, offered [[https://info.juro.com/machine-readable-contracts][a vision for machine-readable contracts]].

** Insight and Vision

[[https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/][Software is eating the world]]. What if we could write and run contracts (and statutes) the way we do programs?

Michael Genesereth, at [[https://codex.stanford.edu/][Stanford's CodeX]], laid out a vision for computational law [[https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1165485.1165517][in ICAIL 2005]] and [[http://logic.stanford.edu/publications/genesereth/complaw.pdf][The Cop in the Back Seat]].

Harry Surden (2014) explains computable contracts on his blog ([[http://www.harrysurden.com/wordpress/archives/203][part 1]], [[http://www.harrysurden.com/wordpress/archives/230][part 2]]) and in a [[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2216866][longer article]] published in the UC Davis Law Review (2014).

[[http://www.susskind.com/][Richard Susskind]] believes that these kinds of innovations will change the future of the legal profession.

** Improving Legal Drafting

In 1978, [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxOaYa8pqqSwdUt5VWdDOWdlREE][Layman Allen complained]] that legal drafting sucks and can learn from logic.

32 years later, in 2010, [[https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8axPLLxhjQFWGc0ellBYTF3RnM][Howard Darmstadter complained]] that legal drafting sucks and can learn from software.

Another 32 years later, in 2042, will thinkers still be complaining about the state of legal drafting? Not if we can help it.

Hypothesis: natural language generation, using tools like [[http://grammaticalframework.org/][GF]], can automate the production of legal English. (Much legal English already has the look and feel of a compiled object. We just need to work out what it compiles /from/.)

** Automated Consistency Checking and Loophole Detection

Hypothesis: the CS field of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification][Formal Verification]] can improve legal construction using the same tools that improve software development.

In Sep 2017 the Atlantic Magazine discussed how FV could save the world from [[https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/][The Coming Software Apocalypse]].

See pages 6 to 9 of [[https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8151][Dramatically Reducing Software Vulnerabilities (2016)]] for a concise summary of different formal methods.

** Rules As Code

** Designing a DSL

Our domain-specific language will draw on inspirations from
- specification languages like [[https://learntla.com/pluscal/][TLA+]] and [[https://alloy.readthedocs.io/][Alloy]],
- ontology software like [[https://protege.stanford.edu/][Protégé]] for [[https://www.w3.org/OWL/][OWL]],
- functional languages like [[https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/6didpj/to_haskell_or_to_ocaml/][Haskell and Ocaml]], and also, [[http://winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html][uh, Lisp]]
- logic programming languages like [[https://www.metalevel.at/prolog][Prolog]], [[http://flora.sourceforge.net/][Flora-2]], and [[http://lps.doc.ic.ac.uk/][LPS]], and
- model-driven architecture standards like [[https://camunda.com/bpmn/][BPMN]] and [[https://camunda.com/dmn/][DMN]] (for which [[http://camunda.com/][Camunda]] is building [[http://bpmn.io/][tools in Javascript]]).
- interactive development environments like [[https://martinfowler.com/bliki/IllustrativeProgramming.html][Excel, the most common programming language in the world]] that nobody thinks of as a programming language.

* A Medium Survey of the Literature and Technologies

See the [[https://legalese.com/prior-art][Legalese survey of prior art]].

Specific technologies we aim to build on:

** Natural Language Generation

with Grammatical Framework; read http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~aarne/articles/cade2011.pdf

** Model-Driven Architectures

while the first wave of MDA came and went leaving little but UML behind, a new generation of DMN and BPMN modeling tools bear promise. In particular, DMN is amenable to static analysis, such as exhaustiveness checking, conflict detection.

** Constraint and Logic Programming

At the intersection of:
- functional programming
- logic programming
- constraint programming
- SMT integration

See [[https://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/piskac/papers/2019HallahanETALquasiquoter.pdf][G2Q]] and Curry ([[https://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~curry/tutorial/tutorial.pdf][tutorial]], [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry_(programming_language)][Wikipedia]], website, [[https://www-ps.informatik.uni-kiel.de/kics2/][KiCS2]]).

As a learning exercise: represent the rules regarding an AGM as a system of constraints, and treat as a planning problem the question of "what paperwork in what order needs to be issued by what actors?"

** IDE integration for the DSL

While interactive theorem provers are the extreme example of "AI Augmentation" in "CASE" tooling, editors like VS Code offer code completion, linting and other mechanisms. It would be really interesting to see how those mechanisms could translate to interactive legal drafting in a DSL.

** Formal Methods

Broadly defined, including symbolic execution, model checking, type systems (basic, dependent, and more advanced), and syntactic (e.g. decision tables). Consider ontology inference as a problem domain related to type inference. See the Rates Rebates case study for an example.

** Contracts as Code:

A contract is a serialization of a specification for a distributed system.

A company can be modelled as the sum of its contracts.
